Steps for generating terrain
1) determine whether tile is land or ocean
	pseudocode
		select x random tiles
		x.biome = ocean
		get x neighbours
		for t in neighbours
			t.biome is ocean

2) determine temperature region borders

3) determine height of land tile

4) determine whether land tile is arid, wet, or between
	*4.1) polar tiles cannot be wet, and most are arid
	4.2) mountain ranges should cast rain shadows

5) apply appropriate terrain based on conditions


Temperature regions:
	1) polar
	2) temperate
	3) temperate
	4) dry
	5) tropical
	6) tropical
	7) dry
	8) temperate
	9) temperate
	10) polar
